    "The goal of this project is to provide an individual based upon their fitness objective, specific goals in terms of diet, nutritional information and some sample workout circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: If an individual wishes to \"Bulk Up\" the program will inform them of their target caloric, protein, fat, etc. intake levels. In addition, it will compare their daily food intake with their daily total goals and provide workout recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be done in *three* portions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 1:*** Will save the users preferences and display some basic nutrional recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 2:*** Will take the users dietary intake for the day and compare it against the prior recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Part 3:*** Will create a program which outputs some sample workout circuits for the user."
